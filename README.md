 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Jean's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   <summary><h3>👨‍💻 [Your Name]'s Tech Expedition</h3></summary>
   My journey through the realms of IT and software engineering began with humble beginnings as a computer science enthusiast, thirsty for knowledge in all facets of the programming world - from coding to Unix, Linux, and theory. Alongside my academic pursuits, I delved into the intricacies of iOS development, fueled by a dream to engineer my own app. Yet, as time progressed, my passion pivoted towards mastering Java, leading me to secure a full-stack software engineering position fresh out of university.

   Despite the professional success, a lingering ambition gnawed at me - the desire to craft my own digital solutions. Though my journey briefly veered into content creation, I soon found myself drawn back to the core of my expertise - IT and software engineering. The allure of building something tangible, something uniquely mine, beckoned me forward.

   Now, as I reflect on my journey, I'm reminded of the dream I once set aside - the dream to create my own software product. It's time to rekindle that flame of innovation, to embrace the challenges of entrepreneurship within the tech landscape.

   To that end, I'm taking proactive steps to realign my focus towards software engineering and IT, paving the way for the pursuit of my entrepreneurial aspirations. By implementing strategic measures, I aim to dedicate more time and energy towards honing my skills and bringing my ideas to life. With preparations underway, I'm poised to embark on a new chapter of my tech journey, ready to make waves in the world of software innovation.
